# Scheduling Optimization Tool

## Project Overview
This project aims to design and develop a web-based optimization tool to support course registration and timetabling in academic institutions. The system applies optimization algorithms to generate feasible, conflict-free schedules while accounting for real-world constraints such as time clashes and capacity limits. The project also intends to expirment with and compare different optimization algorithms for scheduling purposes.

This repository contains work for the **Junior Project** phase and is intended for academic purposes.

## Project Scope
- Focus on **course registration and timetabling from an administrative perspective**
- Design and prototype a web-based scheduling tool
- Research, implement, and compare optimization algorithms

**Out of Scope (Planned for Senior Project):**
- Student-facing schedule generation
- Preference-based optimization for individual students
- Full system integration and deployment

---

## Current Project Phase
**Junior Project**

The current phase emphasizes requirements analysis, system design, algorithm research, and prototype development rather than a fully functional application.
